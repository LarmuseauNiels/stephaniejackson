                  <p>
              I was pleasantly surprised with my experience Stephanie she is very professional & listened to what I wanted, I had no issues at all in this whole process. I had a terrible experience with my brows a long time ago & never thought I could get them fixed but she exceeded my expectations and I absolutely love them. Aside from her great work ethic her work environment is really one of the best I have been in it is very tidy, sterile and made me feel at ease when I came in. I would highly recommend Stephanie her work is meticulous and she literally changed my confidence and now has a customer for life xxx

              Stephanie is simply the best!!! Really happy with the result and she’s such a lovely lady! I postponed having this treatment as I feared the worst…I am not the bravest person but the procedure wasn’t painful whatsoever and Stephanie made me feel at ease. Thank you Stephanie for my new eyebrows! Big hugs and look forward to seeing you soon
