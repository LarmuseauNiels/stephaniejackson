            <h2>The Procedure</h2>
            <p>The procedure involves a needle that implants pigment colour into the dermal layer of the skin. Using this specialised instrument, sharp lip lines and lip colour can be achieved.</p>
            <p>After your first treatment, the colour of the treated area will fade up to  70% and appear slightly different to your desired colour. So, to complete treatment it is advised for the client to return after a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks, for their touch up procedure. At this appointment, the colour, shape and density can be altered to create your final results, which can last up to 12-18 months, leaving maintenance minimal.</p>
