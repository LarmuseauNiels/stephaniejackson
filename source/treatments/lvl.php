    <h2>LVL</h2>
    <p>Stephanie Jackson is a fully qualified Lvl Lash technician, trained by the UKs leading eyelash company, Nouveau Lashes.</p>
    <p>LvL is the new version of the old fashioned perm! It stands for Length, Volume, Lift.</p>
    <p>Your natural lashes will be straightened at the root, creating the appearance of longer, fuller looking eyelashes without the need for mascara. Your eyes will appear more open and brighter!</p>
    <p>An eyelash tint will be applied at the end of the treatment to give your lashes a glossy finish.</p>
    <p>The treatment is painless and takes approximately 45 minutes. Your eyes will be closed throughout the procedure.</p>
    <p>Your eyelashes will stay enhanced to their fullest for anywhere up to 6/8 weeks.</p>
    <p>Aftercare</p>
    <p>No water exposure or mascara should be worn for 24 hours post treatment. Once 24hrs have passed all products can be used as normal on your eyelashes.</p>
    <p>All Nouveau products are carefully manufactured and tested to prevent any damage to your natural lashes</p>
