                <p>Had my eyebrows done yesterday and I’m over the moon with the result. I had been contemplating having them done for a couple of years and only wish I’d had them done sooner. Stephanie is super talented and an absolute doll xxxx</p>

                <p>I have had my eyebrows and lips done-I had my lips done before at a different place but they were uneven then I came to Stephanie and she did them amazing so I had my brows done as well now when I wake up I’m the morning it takes me hardly any time to get ready plus the shape and colour of the brow is perfect much better than I could do myself with make up at first I was nervous but it’s the best investment I ever did feels like you have a perfect make up artist at all times love want my eye liner done now </p>

                <p>Thank you so much to Steff!
                    This was my second session and as usual her sensitivity as well as professionalism is what makes me and all my friends continue to give Steff our business when it comes to semi-permanent make-up.
                    Will fully recommend Steph Jackson, 100%.</p>

                <p>After years of hardly any eyebrows and thin lips A friend told me about Stephanie. I have to say that I’m more than happy with my new eyebrows and fuller lips. Makeup takes half the time to apply now. My lips stay looking fuller, without the need for lip liner and my eyes stand out more with my fuller and better shaped eyebrows. Anyone having second thoughts need not worry. It’s virtually painless and results are amazing</p>

                <p>I Got my eyebrows done by the lovely Stephanie today, I am so happy with the results. Done a lot of research before I booked up with Stephanie.. was amazed with her work and excellent reviews that’s why I choose her and with out a doubt I am so glad I picked her. She was so easy to talk to like I had know her for years. There was no pain and Stephanie put me at ease.. so happy.. will never let anyone touch my eyebrows again except Stephanie. Thanks Stephanie x</p>

                <p>I researched for a very long time to make sure I was confident I had chosen the best person to do my Microblading. Stephanie was by far the best from the very start of the research stage. And after having my brows done yesterday I couldn’t be more happier, for some one with overly plucked brows to now having the most natural looking perfect brows, I couldn’t be more happier. Thank you Stephanie x</p>
